# NextCloud Sync

This project is a way to upload files from customer and working team
with nextcloud and do a copy all of the files submited by the customer
to his accountant (was made for an accountant).

My customer did want to get files transfer by e-mail anymore.
We did install a Nexcloud server for him and we setup this process.

It is now the version alpha of this project.

From 1 use case to a fully usable prouct.

This e-space will let you transmit all your files to your accoutnant.
For all New document transmission, please use the *UPLOAD* folder.

And the accountant will find this files in a shared by admin repository/Client_name/download.

It also work from the accountant to his customer.

It is a bit too simple now.
